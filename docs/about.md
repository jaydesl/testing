# About

<!-- TODO: Add front matter with title, description, and icon -->

This section explains the key concepts, design decisions, and methodology
behind DinoSoft. Read this if you want to understand how and why things
work the way they do.

## The DinoDiet project

<!-- TODO: Replace the ASCII pipeline below with a Mermaid diagram:
     See: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/diagrams/ -->

DinoSoft is the software component of the DinoDiet research project, a
fictional study that aims to analyse the dietary habits
of dinosaurs during the late Cretaceous [period](https://lychee.cli.rs/installation/).

The project follows a four-stage pipeline:

    Collection --> Analysis --> Visualisation
                       |--> Conclusion

DinoSoft implements the Data Analysis stage, providing tools to load,
filter, and compute metrics from the collected dietary data.

## The Hunger Factor

<!-- TODO: Render the formulas below with pymdownx.arithmatex / MathJax:
     $$\text{HF} = \sqrt{(\text{food_kg_per_day})^2}$$
     See: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/math/ -->

The Hunger Factor (HF) is the central metric in the DinoDiet methodology.
It is defined as:

    HF = sqrt(food_kg_per_day ^ 2)

This simplifies algebraically to the absolute value of daily food intake:

    HF = |food_kg_per_day|

<!-- TODO: Convert to collapsible admonition: !!! question "Why not just use the absolute value?" -->

Why not just use the absolute value? The sqrt(x^2) formulation is retained
for compatibility with the original DinoDiet paper (Geller, 2024). In
practice, since `food_kg_per_day` is constrained to be non-negative, the
HF is simply equal to the raw intake value.

This is a deliberate design choice: we preserve the original formula so
that results are reproducible against the published methodology, even
though a simpler implementation would be equivalent.

### Interpreting the Hunger Factor

| HF range | Interpretation | Example species |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| < 10 | Low intake — small-bodied species | Velociraptor (2.0), Oviraptor (3.0) |
| 10–200 | Moderate intake | Stegosaurus (70.0), Spinosaurus (100.0) |
| > 200 | High intake — large-bodied species | Tyrannosaurus (230.0), Brachiosaurus (400.0) |

## Food ratios

<!-- TODO: Render the formula with MathJax  -->

While the Hunger Factor captures absolute intake, the food ratio captures
intake relative to body size:

    food_ratio = food_kg_per_day / weight_kg

This is important because a large absolute intake may represent a small
proportion of body weight for a massive animal.

<!-- TODO: Convert the two comparisons below into content tabs:
     === "Brachiosaurus"  /  === "Velociraptor"
     And wrap in an admonition: !!! example "Comparing Brachiosaurus and Velociraptor"
     See: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/content-tabs/ -->

Comparing Brachiosaurus and Velociraptor:

Brachiosaurus: Weight 56,000 kg, daily intake 400 kg, food ratio 0.007
(0.7%). A massive herbivore, but its daily intake is less than 1% of
body weight.

Velociraptor: Weight 15 kg, daily intake 2 kg, food ratio 0.133 (13.3%).
Tiny by comparison, but eating over 13% of its body weight daily. Small
predators have much higher metabolic demands relative to their size.

## Diet classifications

<!-- TODO: Add emoji icons to the table rows: :material-leaf:, :material-food-drumstick:, :material-food-apple:
     See: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/icons-emojis/ -->
<!-- TODO: Consider adding footnotes for the proportion source using [^1] syntax
     See: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/footnotes/ -->

DinoSoft uses three diet categories, modelled as the `DietType` enum:

| Type | Description | Proportion |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Herbivore | Plant-eating species | ~65% |
| Carnivore | Meat-eating species | ~25% |
| Omnivore | Mixed diet species | ~10% |

These proportions come from the DinoDiet project estimates and broadly
align with palaeontological consensus for the late Cretaceous period.

## Why a dataclass?

<!-- TODO: Convert "Benefits of dataclasses" into an admonition: !!! success "Benefits"
     Convert the Pydantic note into a collapsible admonition: ??? note "What about Pydantic?" -->

The `Dinosaur` model is implemented as a Python `dataclass` rather than
a plain dictionary or a full ORM model. This was a deliberate choice:

Benefits of dataclasses:

- Type safety — fields have declared types, caught by linters
- Immutability-friendly — easy to make frozen if needed
- Readable — auto-generated `__repr__` makes debugging easy
- Lightweight — no external dependencies, just the standard library
- Extensible — new fields can be added with defaults, preserving backwards compatibility

For a production library, Pydantic would add validation, serialisation,
and schema generation. We chose `dataclass` here to keep DinoSoft
dependency-free and focused on teaching documentation practices rather
than data modelling.

## Design philosophy

DinoSoft follows several principles:

1. Simplicity over cleverness — every function does one thing and has a clear name
2. No hidden state — all functions are pure; they take inputs and return outputs without side effects
3. Composable — functions accept and return `list[Dinosaur]`, so they can be freely chained together
4. Documented by default — every public function has a docstring with a working example

These principles make DinoSoft suitable as a teaching example for
documentation-driven development.
